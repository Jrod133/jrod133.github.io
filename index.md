### CSPC 120

*lab 1 

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was the very first time i ever learned how to code. I was pretty nervous at first
    because i was clueless of what i was doing but I shortly we started practicing. The lab overall was simple but entertianing 
    because i learned how to use std::cout and how to start a function.

*lab 7

    Lab 7 was challenging but turned out to be one of my favorites. this lab contained many parking signs we had to keep track of in
    order for our code to work making it difficult. We were also introduced to if statements and bools making the lab entertaining.

*lab 10

    Lab 10 introcuded us to multi vectors that i found intresting. For this lab we created a function that searched through multiple 
    vectors to give us the population, area, and density. I find vectors intresting so the fact that I learned there can be multiple 
    vectprs within a vector was amusing to me.
